# CPUsage's Gridvid Core #

This project was created to make developer's life easier by 
providing a objected oriented version of CPUsage's Gridvid API.

Neither this project or the developer have any relation to CPUsage 
company whatsoever, and any issues/questions related to this project 
should be contacted to the developer only.

## Limitations ##

Gridvid Core is created solely for the aim of simplifying the serialization/
deserialization of Gridvid's encoding requests, and not the interactions.

Hence, do note that Gridvid Core is not a 100% complete wrapper for Gridvid 
API.

## Support ##

Please feel free to fork the project, make improvements or bug fixes and 
submit pull requests. Ideally, all pull requests should also come with tests!

## Author ##

Gridvid Core is maintained by Gustavo Matias.
